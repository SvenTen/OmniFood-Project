# Omnifood-Project
A course project website that utilizes HTML &amp; CSS only.

This is my first big project I have worked on and built by hand to solidify my learning of HTML and CSS as well as giving me a glimpse into JS towards the end of the project.
This project has thaught me how to think and structure my projects in a way that ensures I remain consistant and organised. Before this project my code was messy. I have really taken my time with this project to organise myself & the code as well as focusing on each and every section methodically & thoughtfully.
The focus in this project as been on learning standard practices used in the real world to ensure consistant responsiveness of the website as well as compatibility for all types of users.
